CodeIgniter Boot
================

This is the boot configuration for my CodeIgniter based projects

It's still in the beginning but the important part is done for now in the `MY_Controller.php` and `MY_Model.php` files
where the hard work for working with Models and Controllers is done.

Some feaatures:

Model
-----

Very generic

* CRUD (get/insert/delete/)
* Selector (by)

Controller
----------

* Allow autoloading views (`_remap`)
